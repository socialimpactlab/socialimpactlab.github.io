<span class="larger-bolder"> At SIMLab, we know how to design sustainable, cost-effective and effective systems and services that work.</span>

Whether you're a non-profit, government, or aid agency, SIMLab can transform the way you use technology in your social change work. We help our partners execute on ground-breaking projects to improve their programmatic work and advocacy. We help communities hold institutions accountable, help advocacy organizations fight through bureaucracy to protect rights, and help individuals to participate in the systems critical to their livelihoods.

We are available for grant funding, including fundraising and proposal processes; tenders and RFPs; and one-off consulting to support specific aspects of the project cycle or strategic development processes. We offer subscription services for longer, repeating, or uncertain engagements. The services below are an idea of our competencies but most engagements are a combination of many of these - and our project management, facilitation, design, and technology expertise.

To work with us, send us an email at [hello@simlab.org](mailto:hello@simlab.org)

## Context analysis: Understanding the communications context
Building on our [Context Analysis methodology](http://simlab.org/resources/contextanalysis), we conduct rapid (1-week) assessments to provide a snapshot of the communications context and recommendations for appropriate technology and implementation requirements. For example: the [ICT for Community Policing project](http://simlab.org/blog/2017/01/31/icts-and-human-security/).

{% include html/sectionlink.html link="Tech design" %}

*The staff are friendly and very professional, and take time to listen and engage everyone in finding practical solutions that they can own themselves. This leads to much quicker uptake of technology to address growth in the organization. - Liz Odera, Sadili Sports Academy*

## Technology Specification and Design
SIMLab designs and manages technology solutions that work for everyone. We start with a workshop and design a solution together with partners, develop specifications to find tools that fit, solicit and manage software developers, and evaluate technology solutions. For example: The [MApps project](http://www.elrha.org/hif-blog/linking-affected-communities-to-mine-action-in-ukraine-phase-1-of-developing-platforms/).


{% include html/sectionlink.html link="Evaluation" %}

*It was a pleasure to work with Laura and her team. I would highly recommend them to others seeking technical expertise in the future. - Lauren Pucci, Global Disaster Preparedness Center, American Red Cross*

## Monitoring & Evaluation for tech for social good projects
We can design and implement, or simply offer technical input on, a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation approach for your tech-enabled project, supported by our [Monitoring and Evaluation Framework](http://www.simlab.org/resources/mandeoftech). We also offer evaluation as a service. For example, we developed an M&E Plan for DDG’s MApps project (above), and are currently evaluating Groupe URD’s Sigmah platform.

{% include html/sectionlink.html link="Feedback" %}

## Designing and implementing feedback loops
We can help build tech-enabled systems for collecting and acting on feedback from clients, constituents, and users, no matter where they are. For example: [feedbackmechanisms.org](http://feedbackmechanisms.org)

{% include html/sectionlink.html link="Responsible Data" %}

*I found SIMLAB very approachable and able to help those of us less technically minded to understand using mobile data for data collection. - Anne Garbutt, INTRAC*

## Practical Ethics of Data for tech for social good
For work that involves sensitive data, SIMLab offers additional workshops and guides on managing information in this fraught area. Our context analysis frameworks help organizations identify hidden vulnerabilities in communities they serve, and find tools and procedures to minimize data-related risk for client communities.
