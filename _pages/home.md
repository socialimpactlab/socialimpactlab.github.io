We provide strategy, design, and evaluation support to engage hard-to-reach communities, all over the world.

For people on the wrong side of the digital divide, technology can help or hinder access to their rights and basic needs.

SIMLab helps organizations to design strategies that meet people where they are, using inclusive technology. From radio to social media, from SMS to Whatsapp, from the mobile web to community noticeboards, the right channels are accessible and easy to use, affordable, two-way, and trusted. We help you find them and build for them.

We are closing early next year. [You can read more about why in this blog post](simlab.org/blog/2017/09/06/simlab-is-closing/). But at the moment, we’re open for business, preserving our resources and learning for posterity, dropping some last-minute wisdom on our blog and in op-eds, and providing consulting services. [Read more about what we can do for you, here.](http://www.simlab.org/services/)

Our staff are looking for new homes. They are, to a one, excellent. [You should hire them.](http://www.simlab.org/team/)

We are behind on staff paychecks and some other liabilities. If you’ve ever used our resources, been a client or partner, or simply enjoyed our cheery presence in the world, please consider helping us pay off what we owe by [making a donation here.]( https://www.paypal.me/simlab/35)
