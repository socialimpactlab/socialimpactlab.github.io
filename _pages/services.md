Whether you're a non-profit, government, or aid agency, SIMLab can help you bring professional rigor to your technology for social change projects. We offer a range of services with flat pricing at all stages of your work, from idea to final evaluation.

In addition to project-focused consulting, we also work with clients on policy advice, organizational strategy, and systems-level analysis. Finally, we offer a subscription-based retainer service, where we embed into your organization (or group of organizations), introducing best practice technology and change management approaches, and building innovative projects to solve difficult organizational roadblocks.

To work with us, send us an email at [hello@simlab.org](mailto:hello@simlab.org)

# Idea to Prototype
We’ll get you from the first spark of an idea to a concrete plan for implementing a project and evaluating its success. Our approach is intensive and as comprehensive as you need, with immersive workshops, user-centered research, rapid prototyping, and participatory requirements-building. We’ll work with you at every step of building your technology project, so that at the end of our process, you not only have a plan for the project itself, but you’re more informed about how to maintain and adjust the project to ever-changing conditions. These services include:    

  * User Persona Workshops
  * System Wireframes
  * RFP and Specification Development
  * Context Assessment
  * Prototyping and Testing

# Technology Adoption Management
Integrating new technology can be fraught with hidden and confounding challenges. We take a systems-driven approach to technology adoption and integration, helping you understand how a new piece of technology integrates into existing process and information flows, and how best to adjust to a newly digital environment. For mission-driven organizations, we can analyze and optimize the impact of new technology on your most vulnerable clients, helping to ensure that no one is left behind, and that your organizational ethics remain uncompromised. These services include:

* Systems and Process Analysis
* Training and Support Planning
* Client Impact Workshops
* Data Ethics and Digital Integrity Workshop

# Feedback Loops, Monitoring & Evaluation, Documentation
Opportunities for learning and improvement are everywhere, and SIMLab can help you capture them. We work with non-profits, governments, and other social change actors to build systems for collecting and acting on feedback from clients, constituents, and users, no matter where they are. Planning or running a technology project? SIMLab can design and implement a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan that emphasizes the larger system a technology is being implemented in, from rollout to training and support to the capacity of responding institutions. When a project is complete, we’re available to analyze, interpret, and synthesize project data, building case studies and best practice documents to help crystalize your evaluations into permanent, scalable learnings. These services include:

* Outreach and Feedback Workshops
* Monitoring and Evaluation Design
* Case Study Development
* Best Practice Convenings


# Policy and Systems Analysis
Nothing exists in isolation, least of all technology. Engage with us to take stock of how technology fits into your world. We work with governments and institutions to develop policy recommendations around technology, inclusion, and accountability. We audit, analyze, and optimize service and policy ecosystems, from legal processes to libraries to land titling, helping to ensure that they’re as accessible as possible. For subject-matter experts looking to apply technology to tackle the most wicked challenges in their fields, SIMLab can help build frameworks of prerequisites, risks, and best practices, to help ensure that any solution is as comprehensive and effective as possible. These services include:

* Policy Advice and Analysis
* Technology Systems Audit
* Accessibility Audit
* Best Practice Identification and Framework Building
