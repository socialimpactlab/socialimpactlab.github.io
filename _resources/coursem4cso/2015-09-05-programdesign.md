Experiment: Program Design Considerations
This document takes you through some of the project design considerations that we’ve found help people to make their project a success. We have left it as a Microsoft Word document so that you can use it as a working document to inform your thinking and adjust to your own needs and context, in [English](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/SIMLab%20Program%20Design%20Considerations_Eng.docx), [French](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/SIMLab%20Program%20Design%20Considerations_FR.doc), and [Spanish](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/SIMLab%20Program%20Design%20Considerations_Spa.docx) and Spanish graphic [here](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/Use%20Case%20Map%20Graphic_SPA.docx).
