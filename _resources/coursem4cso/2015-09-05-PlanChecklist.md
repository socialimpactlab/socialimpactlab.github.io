Plan created [this document](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/Plan%20Checklist.doc/) to support their country officesâ€™ use of ICTs in a way that was both strategic and effective, while also allowing them to better understand and document the ICT4D context in the different countries where they are working. Country offices wanted to ensure that they were incorporating ICTs into their work based on real needs and interest from the ground, both internally and with communities.
