We are excited to open applications for Social Impact Lab's upcoming online course, "Scalable, Low-Cost Technologies for Civil Society Organizations", which will run from 24 February- 5 May 2015. You can apply [here](http://courses.frontlinesms.com/sign-up/).

## What is the course about?  
The course will guide participants through the use of [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com/technologies/frontlinesms-overview/) and [FrontlineCloud](http://www.frontlinesms.com/technologies/frontlinecloud-overview/).  Modules focus on using the SMS-based two-way communication platform in your programs, and participants will be directly supported to build a project portfolio of their own submitted work based on course assignments, in around 2-3 hours per week. Other topics include how to design mobile-centered or mobile-enabled projects, risk-mapping, data integrity and ethics considerations when using ICTs and mobile phones in civil society, democracy, transparency, and accountability initiatives. The course is made possible by a grant from the United Nations Democracy Fund.

## Who is this course for?
The course is designed for people at small and medium organizations, primarily non-profits and NGOs focused on democracy, civic engagement, transparency and accountability. We’ve done our best to optimize the course for low-bandwidth users. However, you will need internet connectivity in order to participate in the course.

## What is the commitment?  
Participants will spend about 2-3 hours each week engaging with the platform and materials, with optional online clinic hours offered twice a week for people who want to ask questions in real-time. The course will run for 10 weeks, with 2 weeks for each module to accommodate busy working schedules, from 24 February-5 May 2015.

To encourage participation and help cover some of the costs of the course, we’re charging a nominal fee of $50, payable through Paypal (or alternate means if this is not possible for you).

## How do I apply?  
Fill out our [registration form](http://courses.frontlinesms.com/sign-up/) by 13 February. We'll accept 35-40 participants and will let you know the status of your application by 18 February.

## Course Fee
If accepted, you will be sent a link to our PayPal account to pay your course fee of $50.00.  If you need an alternative payment arrangement, or to request a scholarship, please email [courses@simlab.org](mailto:courses@simlab.org).

## What if I have other questions?  
You can read about the course in more depth [here](http://courses.frontlinesms.com/how-it-works/). If you have any additional questions, send us an email at [courses@simlab.org](mailto:courses@simlab.org).
