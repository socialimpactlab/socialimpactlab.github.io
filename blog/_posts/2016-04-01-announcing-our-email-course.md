Did you miss our online course, ["Scalable, Low-Cost Technologies for Civil Society Organizations"](http://simlab.org/blog/announcements/2014/12/11/simlabs-mobile-technology-training/)? Now you can take it at your own pace! Sign up for our new email-based course [here](https://simlab.typeform.com/to/SPMA57).

The course is designed primarily for non-profits, NGOs, and CSOs who are interested in using mobile in their work, with examples from similar organizations working in democracy, transparency, and accountability. We’ve done our best to optimize the course for low-bandwidth users and busy working professionals, with some of the key materials available in French and Spanish.

## What is the course about?  
The course will guide participants through planning a project with SMS and mobile phones, using [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com/technologies/frontlinesms-overview/) and [FrontlineCloud](http://www.frontlinesms.com/technologies/frontlinecloud-overview/).  Topics include: how to design mobile-centered or mobile-enabled projects, risk-mapping, data integrity and ethics considerations. The course has been made possible by a grant from the United Nations Democracy Fund.

## How long will it take?
This is a self-paced course, so you can take it as slow or as fast as you’d like. There are five modules that we estimate will each require one to three hours to complete. Each module includes reading(s), an audio-visual resource, and a technical walkthrough (posted as a video and audio file) with accompanying technical tasks. The media and materials used in each module are downloadable.

## Registration and course fee
