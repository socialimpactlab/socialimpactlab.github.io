In late December 2017, the Board, with me recused, agreed unanimously to cease operations effective the end of the month. As I wrote [in my announcement post](http://simlab.org/blog/2017/09/06/simlab-is-closing/), and in follow-up 'What Happened' pieces [here](http://simlab.org/blog/2017/12/13/what-happened-part-i/) and [here](http://simlab.org/blog/2017/12/19/what-happened-part-ii/), it's incredibly sad to be losing our team, our ethos, and the good we could have done - but there's so much to look back on.

We're behind on staff salaries, and some bills. If you liked what we did, or ever used our resources, please [donate](https://www.paypal.me/simlab/35) to help us close as gracefully as possible. [Hire our team](http://simlab.org/team)! And help the team build the first digital prototype of a new way to break down the barriers to effective ICT4D: [BetterBox.tech](http://www.BetterBox.tech).

If you haven't already, check out our [blog](http://www.simlab.org/blog), our [resources](http://www.simlab.org/resources), and our [history and principles](http://www.simlab.org/about).

Thanks again, everyone, for everything.

To celebrations to come.

Laura
