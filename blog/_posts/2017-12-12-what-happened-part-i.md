This is the second of two posts about the causes of SIMLab's closure (part I is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-ip2cZ3LNrTEUSnyRJFlzDM4rXgwkttAEi8udwKMJo/edit#)). This post focuses on the more operational issues, and offers 5 unsolicited tips for non-profit CEOs everywhere - particularly introverted, detail-oriented ones.

## 1. Hire the skills you don't have.

I remember congratulating myself, in conversation with my husband one day, on the diversity of our team, and looking at Sean to see his mouth hanging open. 'What are you _talking_ about?' he said. 'Every single one of you is introverted!'

For one thing, yes, introverted and English. I come from a totally different business development environment. Looking back, I should have found a Washington insider to do that bit. But also, if your skill is in shaping projects, writing things and having ideas, then spend what time you can carve out of CEO-ing there and get someone else in for the rest. You'll be happier and your business will be too.

## 2. Don't do the detail yourself.

As the leader of a small organization, you always need to be executing on three fronts, in addition to actually carrying out the core business: honing and maintaining your strategic vision; selling your core 'thing'; and running a tight ship operationally. It's critical to know yourself well enough to know which of those things you suck at, and find people to do those things for you, see 1) above.

But even for the things you're good at, try and make enough money as soon as you can to ensure that you can remove yourself from direct responsibility for the day to day on almost all of it. Your job should be strategic vision first and foremost, and being a good figurehead and troubleshooter for the rest. A thoughtful and perceptive proof-reader of this post points out: most of the role is knowing when to hold money and when to invest it, and the details are where you build the team. This reminds me of [this excellent piece](http://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/). And I am not good at that. I'm a details person, and when I struggled in the early months and years to set out a focussed, clear vision, I could distract myself from it with administration and project delivery.

In particular, find a good COO as soon as you can. It has taken me most of my time at SIMLab (including the FrontlineSMS years) to find Kat, who aside from being one of the best humans there is, is the first COO we've ever had who could genuinely relieve me of the administrative burden of being the only one who understood our complex financial and legal structure. Being CEO means having to do everything that no-one else wants to do, and this means either handling admin yourself or managing the outsourcing of it. Whichever you choose, make it someone else's job, and invest in their seniority and decision-making capacity.

## 3. Keep it simple.

SIMLab began in 2014 as a refreshed brand for a 501(c)(3) that had already been open for seven years, trying to do a very hard thing: run an open-source software platform. We had significant administrative complexity. Due to a combination of circumstance, error and excitement, we had set up far too many companies, in three different countries. Don't do this. Keep everything as lean and simple as you can, in the least complicated organizational form you can, in the fewest countries you can. If you have to operate elsewhere, work through partners or (genuine) consultancies.

## 4. Fundraise for reserves, don't undersell yourself and charge late fees.

Grant administration finalizes late. Clients pay late. Projects get delayed. In this economic environment, you have to have some buffer against cashflow hiccups. Make it your mission, no matter how hard it is, to have a few months' run rate in the bank. If you don't have this, you are not safe, because you never know when the unthinkable might happen. Prioritize this and get your Board on it too - this is their job as much as yours. Use this target to motivate their giving and getting funds and connections.

And value your work from the beginning. If you have to give discounts to early clients, give them, record them, and write them off as you can. (Also: get a good accountant.)

## 5. Trust no-one.

This is about all I will say about the piece of very bad luck that was the final straw for us, but one more piece of advice: don't do any work whatsoever under any circumstances, no matter how big or small the project, without a document and a signature setting out exactly when and how you will get paid. If your arrangement with a prime deviates from the grant agreement with the funder, get it in writing.

## So what's next?

SIMLab is closing in early 2018. We're behind on staff salaries, and some bills. If you liked what we did, or ever used our resources, please [donate](https://www.paypal.me/simlab/35) to help us close as gracefully as possible. [Hire our team](http://simlab.org/team)! And keep working with us until we close - [we're still consulting!](http://www.simlab.org/services) Get in touch and find out how we can help make technology part of what you do.

In January we're launching a crowdfunder for our last and biggest idea yet: I'm going to widgetize SIMLab's knowledge. If the world won't read our weighty Frameworks, we'll make something fun and beautiful that the world will love.

It's called [BetterBox](http://www.BetterBox.tech), and it's about you.

The people still reading this post are the reason our troubled little sector will be ok. It was you we were writing for. All the Frameworks and tools were for people who work in imperfect systems and institutions, doing hard things in challenging contexts. I want to make something that will help you beat down those barriers and make ICT4D better from the ground up. And I want you to help.

In January, we'll launch the crowdfunder for BetterBox. It creates a way for everyone to use technology ethically and powerfully, in one, gorgeous little box. It contains a deck of cards, each with exercises, workshop techniques, research methods and tips for facilitators to help you understand your audience and use evidence in your work. It will be printable, translatable, and licensed under Creative Commons.

Help us build the first digital prototype. Go to [BetterBox.tech](http://www.BetterBox.tech) and leave us your email, answer one question and we'll be back in January with BetterBox.
