## Creating an Appointment
**YOU SHOULD ASK IF THE MEMBER HAS A CELL PHONE AND IS OK WITH RECEIVING TEXT REMINDERS ABOUT THEIR APPOINTMENT. IF THEY SAY NO, STOP.**

1. Start from the Activities screen, and click the "Create Appointment" button:

2. A form will appear on the right side of the window.

3. Start on the second line, "Member", and fill in the Member's phone number (**starting with +1**). If you find their name in the dropdown list, click it. Otherwise, finish typing the number and click "Add this phone number". You'll see a gray box if the number has been added successfully.

4. If you're adding a Member's number for the first time, fill in their full name. Otherwise, you can leave the name blank.

5. Fill in the "Appointment Time" as hh:mm AM/PM. e.g., 11:00 AM. Fill in the "Appointment Date" as mm/dd/yyyy. e.g., 01/27/2016.

6. Select a location - Perry School or THEARC.

7. Fill in the Member's ID number, even if the Member is already entered into the system.

8. Hit "Fire and create interaction". You'll see a green notification at the top of the screen, indicating that everything worked. You're done!

## Confirming an Appointment
Members will receive an SMS notification two business days before an upcoming appointment. They can text in YES to confirm the appointment (they can't confirm before this time). If they don't, they'll receive another notification the business day before an upcoming appointment, and their names will be added to the "Call to Confirm" list (they'll be automatically removed from the list if they text in YES).

To access the "Call to Confirm List", click on the "People" tab. On the left-hand side, under "Smart Groups", click the "Call to Confirm" group for your office. You'll get a list of Members with unconfirmed appointments, along with their contact information and appointment date/time.
![form]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lift/calltoconfirm.png)

Once you've called a Member to confirm an appointment, you can manually edit their information. Hit "Edit" in the row next to their name.

Change "Confirmed" from "No" to "Yes", then scroll down and hit "Save". (Don't worry about Confirmable. That's set automatically.)
![form]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lift/edit.png)

The member should disappear from the Call to Confirm group, and appear in the "Confirmed Appointments" group.

## Checking on an Appointment
You can search for appointments by member number or name with the search bar at the top of the FrontlineSMS interface.

Under the "People" tab, you can see a list of all members, along with their upcoming appointment  information, by clicking on the smart group "All Members". You can also see the members for Perry School or THEARC by clicking their respective group.

## Creating a Referral
**YOU SHOULD ASK IF THE MEMBER HAS A CELL PHONE AND IS OK WITH RECEIVING TEXT REMINDERS ABOUT THEIR REFERRAL. IF THEY SAY NO, STOP.**

1. To create a referral reminder, go to "Activities", and click "Create Referral". You'll see a form appear on the right side of the window.

2. Start on the second line, "Member", and fill in the Member's phone number (**starting with +1**). If you find their name in the dropdown list, click it. Otherwise, finish typing the number and click "Add this phone number". You'll see a gray box if the number has been added successfully.  

3. Scroll through the "Referral" dropdown. If you can find the referral there, select it. You don't need to do anything else--hit "Fire and Create Interaction" to send the referral.

5. If the referral ISN'T in the list, select "Other". Fill in the referral name and address in the "Other Referral Name" and "Other Referral Address" input boxes, then hit "Fire and Create Interaction" to send the referral.

The Member will receive a reminder about the referral in three (3) business days.
