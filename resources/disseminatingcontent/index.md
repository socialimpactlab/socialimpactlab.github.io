You can download a pdf of the document [here](http://simlab.org/files/SIMLab%20Disseminating%20content%20on%20basic%20phones.pdf). We are sorry this one isn't machine readable - of all the resources to be readable on a phone we wish this one were! But we shut down before we could do it. Get in touch if you want to help convert the pdf to a Markdown file for us.

## About SIMLab
Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) helps people and organizations to use inclusive technologies to build systems and services that are accessible, responsive, and resilient. Until December 2014, SIMLab was the home of the FrontlineSMS project, a suite of software that helps organizations build services with text messages. FrontlineSMS has now spun out as a separate, for-profit social enterprise, and SIMLab continues to focus on solving many of the challenges of implementing projects using inclusive technologies. We support implementation, the sharing of learning and synthesis of best practice, and advocate to decision-makers and donors for policy-level change.
