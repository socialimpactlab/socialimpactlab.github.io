# Background
At SIMLab, we're committed to sharing learning from our work. This paper is the output of a one-day workshop in September 2015, run by SIMLab with the Global Disaster Preparedness Center (GDPC) hosted at the American Red Cross.

In response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the GDPC modified their First Aid app for release in 13 West African countries to include Ebola-related content. In addition to providing information on Ebola transmission, identification and treatment, the app serves as a platform to disseminate messages and alerts through push notifications. However, acknowledging mobile apps can’t reach everyone, GDPC asked SIMLab to help create a strategy to extend their First Aid and Hazard information to reach portions of the population who have not yet gained access to smartphone technology, and considering ways to get content onto basic phones to reach audiences that do not yet have access to smartphone technology.

The workshop, facilitated by SIMLab, invited guests from Mercy Corps, Facebook and Medic Mobile, among others, to share case studies across the spectrum of mobile dissemination tactics. We discussed the pros and cons of each strategy for disseminating content on basic phones, and set out the options clearly. Using this information, GDPC was able to decide on a mobile site for their next generation accessible, inclusive first aid information.

We hope this resource will be helpful for others who find themselves wondering how best to get information to people using low-end mobile technology. As always, it’s important to keep in mind that every context is different. SIMLab recommends conducting a context analysis to understand how technology is already used in the context in which you work. SIMLab’s open-access Framework on context assessments is available _[Here](http://simlab.org/resources/contextanalysis/)_

## The challenge: translating rich, web-based content onto basic phones
Although global growth in smartphone use is growing, and gathering pace as handset prices drop and low-cost, unbranded phones flood out of east Asia, there are and perhaps will always be important groups who don’t have access to them. Even in the US, only 68% of subscribers use smartphones, and 10% aren’t online at all, either at home or using a mobile phone. In the rest of the world, of the 3.5bn mobile subscribers, only 1bn have smartphones. Those without them are excluded by inaccessible handset prices, data and airtime costs, and availability and affordability of electricity for these power-hungry devices.

Nonetheless, the ‘basic phone’ remains dominant in many of these markets, providing low-cost messaging capability through SMS and low-bandwidth apps like Whatsapp and MXIT, voice calls, low-quality images and in many markets, mobile money and other operator-supported services. Making information accessible through these devices makes a lot of sense.

But the basic phone market is complex. Even ten years ago, at the height of its power, individual handset manufacturers would maintain tens of handset models, upgrading each of them multiple times each year with minor hardware and software changes. Nominally identical phones varied per mobile operator, and per market. Operating systems for basic phones were far more diverse and unpredictable than for smartphones – in contrast to the iOS/Android/Windows trifecta, many manufacturers had their own OS, which were tailored to the handset and managed the phone’s interaction with its hardware in a deep way. Ten years on, the picture is similar - but massively complicated by the vast second-hand phone market and glut of phones from China and elsewhere in Asia, about which little can be predicted.

## Strategies for disseminating content on basic phones

### Web-dependent strategies

More phones than ever before can access the internet, and data-driven services, over the mobile network. Even ‘feature’ phones can access websites, albeit on low-quality screens and browsers, and cheap new and second-hand smartphones are increasing the theoretical number of people with access to widening 3- and 4G coverage in frontier markets, particularly in urban areas and on major roads.

These strategies include mobile websites, social media, 'IP-dependent' messaging such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and apps requiring internet access.

| Opportunities | Challenges |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Relatively low-cost and can be spun up swiftly. |
Requires connection to data, appropriate hardware and access to electricity to keep devices charged.|
|If the target population use it, social media can be a great place to 'meet people where they are'| Differing access to time and disposable income for this means that the most vulnerable are more likely to be excluded, including women and girl children, low-income people, and people with disabilities. This may be difficult to make visible.
 |
 | Easy to track and measure engagement   | |  Social media platforms are not all created equal, but have differing functionality, users, and affordances (for example, Twitter has an API but Facebook and WhatsApp do not).|
|  Easy to have two-way conversations   | |   |
|   Relatively easy to refresh content, e.g. by pushing an update to an app  | |    |


Fundamentally, the uneven access to data means that these services are not usually an option, unless you can address the cost and coverage gaps in order to provide access to your users. These services often need complementary strategies to reach ‘left-behind populations’, with options that do not require the internet and a multi-channel approach to offer people choices.

### Hardware-dependent strategies
These strategies include a number of options:
* 'sideloading' content, for example by uploading from the SD card slot on some of the more advanced ‘basic’ phones or via Bluetooth
* SIM apps, which are usually installed by the operator or handset manufacturer and can therefore be rolled out at scale through partnerships at this level. An alternative approach, taken by Medic Mobile, is to use a parallel SIM inserted in the phone next to the normal SIM card.

 | Opportunities    | Challenges     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Content can be richer, meaning that you can provide a more compelling experience and control the format. Done well, you can ensure that local habits and customs are taken into account.     | Variable devices, software and operating systems mean that troubleshooting can be difficult. If devices break down, replacing or repairing them can be difficult. It’s impossible to test comprehensively.| This method avoids any issues with connectivity, as the content does not need to be downloaded.|In low-technology contexts, participants may need training to use and maintain devices. | As our case studies show, it is possible to relatively quickly develop and distribute content under pressure. | This approach is difficult to scale well in a because of the high human resources need. Ideally you might have a way to automate manual tasks, e.g. to copy content onto multiple devices at once. | Distributing hardware provides the opportunity to have an additional positive effect on participants - for example, the recipient of a smartphone may be able to access Facebook and read the news online for the first time. | Given how fast technology and tastes move on, this approach may not be built for longevity. |

These approaches may be appropriate if you have a deep understanding of the context and your target audience, have a local implementer or supporter who can help troubleshoot.

### Challenges encountered when distributing hardware
In the Oppia Mobile example above, although the project was relatively high-touch, healthcare workers took good care of the phones and were encouraged to use them as their personal devices.

In contrast, EngageSpark found that large numbers of their distributed phones were lost or damaged. Some participants sold their new phone batteries and replaced them with old ones, leading to short battery life. Although a challenge for the project, this behavior is rational in a low-income environment where incomes have to be creatively supplemented. Therefore, we can theorize that handset distribution may be more successful where recipients are not under severe financial pressure.

### Viral content
In this variation, your target audience do the distribution for you. If you can create content that is so compelling that it becomes ‘viral’, it may be passed from hand to hand by bluetooth or by ‘sideloading’. Viral content passed from person to person benefits from the trust relationships between people, increasing the likelihood that the content will be acted on. It also benefits from local, human networks. Measuring outcomes is challenging or impossible, without being able to access and track at least some of the consumers of your content. It goes without saying that making ‘viral’ content is very challenging!

### Core Network Service-Dependent Strategies
These options are perhaps the most straightforward, and rely on the standard operator services provided by all mobile networks:
* SMS or text messaging
* Voice calls
* USSD

## About SIMLab
Social Impact Lab (SIMLab) helps people and organizations to use inclusive technologies to build systems and services that are accessible, responsive, and resilient. Until December 2014, SIMLab was the home of the FrontlineSMS project, a suite of software that helps organizations build services with text messages. FrontlineSMS has now spun out as a separate, for-profit social enterprise, and SIMLab continues to focus on solving many of the challenges of implementing projects using inclusive technologies. They support implementation, the sharing of learning and synthesis of best practice, and advocate to decision-makers and donors for policy-level change.
SIMLab defines inclusive technologies as those which embody values critical to truly scalable, locally-owned impact; accessibility, ease of use, interoperability, and sustainability. Mobile is a key example—SMS and voice telephony reach all of the world’s 3.6 billion mobile subscribers—as is radio, a critical technology for broad reach at relatively low cost. We also embrace both ends of the spectrum of inclusive tech—the increasing availability and affordability of cheap web-enabled phones and mobile data make them more accessible for relatively disconnected communities, and more analogue communications technologies, such as public criers, noticeboards and human networks, like religious structures and community leadership, reach into even the most remote and disconnected communities.
