Read: about using ICTs for monitoring and evaluation

This paper looks at how organizations are using ICTs for M&E within their projects. For busy professionals, we’ve included the first two chapters and their checklist terms and executive summary of SIMLab’s Data Integrity Guide [here](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/Rockefeller%20M&E%20Tech%20Shortened.pdf) to make sure you have time for other readings. If you have more time, we’ve also linked the [full report](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/Monitoring-and-Evaluation-in-a-Tech-Enabled-World.pdf) delves into the issues more deeply and offers several case studies as optional further reading.
