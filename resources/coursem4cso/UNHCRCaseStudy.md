Read: a case study on using FrontlineSMS to reach refugees in Costa Rica.

This United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) case study offers an engaging journey through project planning, testing, implementation and reflection with a small pilot group. It considers the trade-offs between prototyping using a custom application versus an existing tool; context assessments; the critical role of a champion for the project in the implementing organization; and monitoring and evaluation. What lessons can we draw from the UNHCR case study? What things are similar to your project? What things would be different within your context?
