Read: selections from SIMLab's Data Integrity Guide

This Data Integrity Guide was written for FrontlineSMS users in 2011. Read the glossary of terms and executive summary of SIMLab’s Data Integrity Guide [here](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/Data%20Integrity%20Short.pdf). If you have more time, the [full document](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/FrontlineSMS%20Data%20Integrity%20Guide.pdf) delves into the issues more deeply and offers several case studies as optional further reading.

 Was there anything that you hadn’t thought about prior to reading the guide? Is there anything you feel is missing? How will you take data integrity into consideration within your organization? What are some potential vulnerabilities in your project or community? How can you reduce some of these risks?
