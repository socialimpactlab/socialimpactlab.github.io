Read: monitoring water service delivery in India

This [short case study](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/Next%20Drop%20Case%20Study.pdf) looks at NextDrop, a mobile-based system that uses SMS to improve water service delivery in India.  Their system is 2-fold: they collect user feedback on behalf of utility companies to improve their services, such as water pressure and quality, and they relay delivery information to users via SMS, such as delays and scheduling updates. If you have more time, the [full report](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/M4D+Impact_Case+Study+Booklet+2014.pdf) has many other case studies as optional further reading.

There are a number of pros and cons in this case study. What role did the mobile service play in monitoring water delivery, and improving water distribution over time? How do NextDrop’s three metrics for users compare to yours? (NextDrop’s metrics are: the number of people receiving information from NextDrop about their water supply; the percentage of those receiving information providing feedback (whether asked or not); and the number of people that will move from SMS to a web-based app for the same water supply information)
