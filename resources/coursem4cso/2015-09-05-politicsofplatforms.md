The political effect of the technology platform itself is often overlooked. The more advanced the platform, the greater its potential to exclude people, whether through educational, financial, or other socioeconomic barriers. Do you think the choice of technical platform is a political one? Do service providers have a duty to use a platform that as many people as possible can access? If they donâ€™t, what does this mean?

This blog post discusses these challenges and is available in [English](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/Politics%20of%20Platforms.pdf), [French](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/La%20politique%20des%20plates-formes_Fr.pdf), and [Spanish](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/La%20pol%C3%ADtica%20de%20las%20plataformas_Spa.pdf).
