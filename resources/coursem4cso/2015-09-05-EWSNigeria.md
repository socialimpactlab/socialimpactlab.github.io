These resources discuss how Search for Common Ground used FrontlineSMS and CrowdMap in Jos, a city in Northern Nigeria, to develop an Early Warning System (EWS).

Start by reading this very short blog post here in [English](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/EWS%20Nigeria%20Blog_Eng.docx), [French](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/EWS%20Nigeria%20Blog_Fr.doc), or [Spanish](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/EWS%20Nigeria%20Blog_SPA.docx).  After that, read the selections from their project evaluation- we’ve pulled out the important parts in [this shorter document](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/SFCG%20Eval%20Short.pdf), but you can access the entire evaluation [here](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/NGR_EV_Nov13_Participatory-Early-Warning-for-More-Effective-Response-to-Religious-Conflict-in-Plateau-State.pdf) as optional reading.

As you can see, the technology didn’t work perfectly in this case study.  By providing this feedback to FrontlineSMS, they have been able to improve the platform to combat these issues. Without this valuable feedback, other users might continue to suffer from the same problems today!

Unfortunately, many organizations do not conduct monitoring or evaluation of the technical components of their projects.  Often, this is because they don’t see the technology as directly relevant to the indicators and other metrics they must report to their donors.  SIMLab is currently working to overcome this by putting together a few resources that can be easily integrated into existing project M&E activities.  You should think about the following questions for your own project:

* How will using FrontlineSMS/Cloud augment or change the programs you have? Or program processes?
* Who is most affected by this project? What do you want to know about their use of the service, or how they are affected by it? How will you gather that information?
* Do you want to monitor one specific use of the software or how the program can be scaled up on a national level?
* What information will be collected, by whom, and on what budget?
* What information would you want to collect about intended and unintended impacts (or consequences) of your program?
