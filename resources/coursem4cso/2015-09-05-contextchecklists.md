Experiment: check out SIMLab's context assessment tool.
Context is king. The best technology is the one that’s right for the community and organization you’re working within, not necessarily the easiest or the newest. Customs and systems that affect the take-up of technologies and innovation are unique to each context. ICT methodologies should capitalize on and integrate with existing tools and familiar communications channels, wherever possible.

We have created an online version of SIMLab’s context assessment to make it easier for you to fill out. Your primary assignment for this module will be to complete the form here. If the online format is difficult for you to access, check out our longer Microsoft Word document here in [English](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/SIMLab%20Context%20Assessment%20Checklist_Eng.docx), [French](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/SIMLab%20Liste%20de%20contr%C3%B4le%20pour%20l%E2%80%99analyse%20de%20contexte_Fr.docx/), and [Spanish](http://simlab.org/resources/coursem4cso/files/SIMLab%20Lista%20de%20control%20para%20el%20an%C3%A1lisis%20de%20contexto_Spa.docx/).
