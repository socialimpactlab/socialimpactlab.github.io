## Board Members and Treasurer

SIMLab's Board is composed of the CEO and four independent members. Of those four, two will reach the end of their two-year term in June 2016 and one has stepped down as she became CEO of another organization. We are excited to invite applications to join us as mentors, advisors, supporters and critical friends as we embark on the next stage of our journey.

We're looking for people with the energy and enthusiasm to help us imagine how a small group of committed people can change the way the world thinks about tech-enabled social change. There are some special skills that would be particularly helpful - individuals with experience of getting complex messages out, advocating for policy change, community organizing, and structuring new product-based lines of business would all be welcome. One role we're particularly looking to fill is that of Treasurer, who will provide oversight and support to our operations team. They don't have to be an accountant, but they do need to be able to read our balance sheet and hold us to account.

We are a diverse team, majority women-identified and 42% people of color. 57% of our team are called  Millennials by fashionable publications, and the rest of us are confused but pretty sure we're Generation Y. We want our Board to reflect the same diversity and welcome applications from people with interesting and relevant experience and interests, whatever their age. Being a Board member is great experience! And we are happy to return the favor.

## Board Terms
SIMLab’s Board Members serve a two-year term to be eligible for re-appointment. Board meetings will be held half-yearly. Independent Board member appointments are staggered, with 50% of seats up for appointment each year.

## Time commitment
As a guide, Board members are expected to commit to two half-day meetings per year, with no more than one to be held in person, and to devote some time to additional review and discussion. The role will require someone who can allocate between one and three half days per month. The majority of this work can be carried out remotely. This time would be used to prepare for Board meetings, occasionally attend sub-committee meetings, and attend meetings, functions and events representing SIMLab.
