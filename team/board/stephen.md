Stephen is an Investments Manager for Humanity United. He has been studying and working to prevent conflict and human rights abuses for more than a decade, working variously on Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe.

Prior to joining HU, he was a senior fellow at The Nexus Fund where he led a strategic reorientation process on atrocity prevention and peacebuilding in Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, and headed strategic planning on issues such as the use of technology for atrocity prevention. Previously, he was a research analyst and team lead at the Institute for the Study of War, where he led the Iraq and GCC teams and wrote and spoke on politics and conflict in the Middle East, authoring the report “Iraq’s Sunnis in Crisis” and appearing on or being quoted in a range of international news media. He has worked on development and disaster relief in Haiti with International Action, and with the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University, where he was also a teaching fellow on foreign policy.

Originally from Canterbury, England, Stephen holds degrees in Politics from the University of Cambridge, International Relations from Yale University, and History from Brown University. He has been awarded a number of fellowships, including a Harry Frank Guggenheim fellowship, a Bourse Chateaubriand fellowship from the French government, a Fox International Fellowship to study at Sciences Po in Paris, and a Mellon Fellowship from the University of Cambridge. In addition to his work at HU, he is also a Penn Kemble Fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy.
