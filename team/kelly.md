Kelly served as a Project Director with SIMLab from 2014 to 2017. She led project management and implementation of our [DFID-funded mobile money project in Kenya](http://simlab.org/resources/lastmilemoney/). In 2015, Kelly returned to our DC office where she provided technical advice on our implementation portfolio, most recently redesigning [an Early Warning System in Kenya](http://simlab.org/blog/2017/06/30/talking-about-tools/). 

Her work centers around effective community and organizational interactions, such as creative two-way communications and feedback mechanisms, and creating methodologies for evidence-based design. Kelly is currently pursuing a MA in Law and Diplomacy at The Fletcher School at Tufts University. She can be reached at kelly.church@tufts.edu or via
