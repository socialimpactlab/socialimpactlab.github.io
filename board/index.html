SIMLab’s Board is composed of the CEO and four independent members, and we’re still looking for our fourth independent board member! We are excited to invite applications to join us as mentors, advisors, supporters and critical friends as we embark on the next stage of our journey.

We would be particularly excited to receive applications from woman-identified folks - we are a majority female team, and it’s very important to us that our Board reflect the diversity of our staff.

We’re also keen to hear from people with experience developing policy and best practice guidance for the non-profit sector and getting that guidance used by implementers, but whatever your background, if you’re interested, we want to hear from you. Most importantly, we’re looking for people with the energy and enthusiasm to help us imagine how a small group of committed people can change the way the world thinks about tech-enabled social change.
